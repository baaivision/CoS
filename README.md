In this work, we introduce **C**hain of **S**tep reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CoS. More importantly, we conduct extensive empirical analysis and ablations to unveil CoSâ€™s appealing properties. We hope this paper offers insights into more complex multi-modal reasoning.
